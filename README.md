# Byte-Sized RSE Session: Introduction to AI-Assisted Programming with GitHub Copilot

## Pre-Session Instructions

To take part in this session, you will need to have a [GitHub](https://github.com/home) account. If you don't have one, you can sign up for free. You will also need to enable [Github Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) in your Github account. There are free and paid for tiers of GitHub Copilot. Students and educators can get access to the Pro version through Github Education, which you can register for [here](https://github.com/edu). It may take up to 10 days to receive access. For this session you can probably make do with the free version, but you may want to register for GitHub Education to get the Pro version to use going forward.

There are several Jupyter notebooks (the files with the extension ```.ipynb```) present in this  repository. You may review them in advance if you want to, but you aren't required to.

## Accessing Session Materials

The easiest way to access these materials is in a GitHub Codespace (instructions below). This requires no setup in advance past the pre-session instructions above.

Alternatively, you may download the session materials on to your own computer, install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and install the following extensions within VS Code:
* [GitHub Copilot](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot) 
* [GitHub Copilot Chat](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot-chat)
* [Python](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python)
* [Jupyter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter)

## Opening a Codespace

These materials are designed to run inside of a [Codespace](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/overview). A Codespace is a development environment hosted by GitHub directly from a repository. To use this, you will need to be signed into a GitHub account. To open the Codespace, click the green ```Code``` button at the top right of the repository. Make sure you're in the ```Codespaces``` tab and click the ```Create New Codespace on main``` button. This will create a Codespace of your own. This will take a minute or so to initialise. You may be asked to reload the page. If so, do reload the page. If the Codespace seems to get stuck loading, reloading the page will often fix the problem.

Once your Codespace has initialised, it will remain associated with your GitHub account for around a month, when it will expire. Your Codespace will be given a name like "fuzzy-barnacle" so you can identify it. To reopen it on a future occasion, click the ```Code``` button again, then select the Codespace, click ```Open```, then ```Open in Browser```.

To download the content of the files within the Codespace, open the Files tab on the left, select the files, right click and click ```Download``` button. Alternatively, if you're familiar with GitHub, you can open the source control tab on the left, you can commit and push changes. This will fork the repository with your changes. Either of these options will allow you to keep a copy of the session notes with your solutions to the exercises, etc.
